User funel in analytics 

A user funnel in analytics represents the steps a user takes to complete a specific goal in your application—such as signing up, making a purchase, or completing onboarding. It helps you visualize where users drop off and how to improve conversion rates.

Example: Sign-Up Funnel in an App
Funnel Step	Drop-off Analysis
1. App Opened	100%
2. Clicked “Sign Up”	70% – Some users don’t proceed
3. Filled Sign-Up Form	50% – Form complexity may be an issue
4. Verified Email	30% – Users not completing verification

2. What tools do you use for user analytics?
Answer:
Tools like:

Google Analytics / GA4

Mixpanel

Amplitude

Hotjar / Crazy Egg

Power BI / Tableau

SQL for custom queries

Session Duration

Retention Rate

Churn Rate

Conversion Rate

Click-Through Rate (CTR)

4. What’s a user funnel and why is it important?
Answer:
A user funnel shows how users progress through steps (e.g., sign-up → onboarding → purchase). It identifies drop-offs and helps optimize conversion paths.

🔹 Intermediate Level
5. How do you track user retention?
Answer:
By calculating the % of users who return on Day 1, 7, 30, etc. (cohort analysis). Tools like Mixpanel and Amplitude offer built-in retention analysis.

6. Explain cohort analysis.
Answer:
Cohort analysis groups users based on shared attributes (like signup date) and tracks how behavior (like activity or purchase) changes over time.

7. How would you find why users drop off after onboarding?
Answer:

Analyze funnel drop-off at onboarding steps

Use session recordings (Hotjar)

Run user surveys or feedback

Compare successful vs unsuccessful user paths

A/B test changes to onboarding flow

8. What SQL query would you use to find daily active users?
Answer:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  event_date, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS daily_active_users
FROM 
  user_events
GROUP BY 
  event_date
ORDER BY 
  event_date;
🔹 Advanced Level
9. How do you measure feature adoption?
Answer:

Define feature use event (e.g., "clicked X")

Track unique users triggering the event

Calculate adoption = (users using feature / eligible users) × 100

Use cohort and time-series analysis to see trends

10. How would you identify power users?
Answer:

Users with high frequency, volume, and depth of engagement

Use metrics like:

of sessions per week
of key actions taken
Time spent per session

Segment users using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) models

11. How do you ensure data quality in analytics?
Answer:

Implement event validation (e.g., schema enforcement)

Remove bots/test traffic

Monitor for anomalies or data gaps

Set up automated data QA checks

Collaborate with engineering on tracking plans

12. Explain the difference between GA4 and Universal Analytics.
Answer:

GA4 is event-based (vs. session-based in UA)

Tracks users across platforms (web + app)

Built-in machine learning for predictions

Uses BigQuery integration for raw data access

No bounce rate (uses engagement metrics instead)

13. How do you segment users effectively?
Answer:

Based on behavior (e.g., frequency of use)

Demographics (location, device)

Lifecycle stage (new, returning, dormant)

Campaign source (organic, paid, referral)

🔹 Bonus: Scenario-Based
14. You notice a drop in retention—what’s your approach?
Answer:

Segment affected users (time, device, campaign)

Review recent product changes/releases

Analyze user feedback/surveys

Watch session replays

Test retention-boosting features (e.g., notifications, onboarding tweaks)

15. What’s your process to track a new feature launch?
Answer:

Define success KPIs

Instrument tracking events (with dev team)

Build funnel + retention dashboards

Monitor adoption, engagement, feedback

Compare new vs old behavior



16. What is the difference between tracking events and pageviews?
Answer:

Pageviews: Count how often a page is loaded (used in web analytics).

Events: Track specific user actions (e.g., clicks, video plays, downloads).

Example: Clicking "Sign Up" is an event, viewing the signup page is a pageview.

17. How do you build a behavioral segmentation model?
Answer:

Identify key user behaviors (e.g., frequency, recency, actions).

Use clustering (e.g., K-means) or RFM analysis.

Segment users (e.g., loyal, dormant, casual).

Apply segmentation in marketing or UX improvements.

18. How do you calculate churn rate?
Answer:

sql
Copy
Edit
Churn Rate = (Users Lost During Period / Total Users at Start of Period) * 100
Example:

Start: 1000 users

Lost: 100

Churn Rate = 10%

19. What is attribution modeling?
Answer:
Attribution modeling assigns credit for conversions to different marketing channels (e.g., email, ads, organic search).

Types:

First Touch

Last Touch

Linear

Time Decay

Data-Driven (GA4 / ML-based)

20. How do you calculate customer lifetime value (CLV)?
Answer:

ini
Copy
Edit
CLV = (Average Purchase Value) × (Purchase Frequency) × (Customer Lifespan)
Helps predict total revenue from a user over their relationship with the product.

🔹 Product & Business Questions
21. How do you measure product stickiness?
Answer:

ini
Copy
Edit
Stickiness = Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU Ratio)
A higher ratio (~20–30%) indicates better engagement.

22. How do you prioritize analytics requests from different teams?
Answer:

Evaluate business impact and urgency

Align with company OKRs

Use RICE or ICE scoring models

Communicate timelines transparently

23. What is a North Star Metric and how do you define one?
Answer:
A single metric that best captures the core value your product delivers.
Example:

Spotify: Time spent listening

Airbnb: Nights booked

WhatsApp: Messages sent

24. How do you evaluate a feature's impact after release?
Answer:

Define KPIs pre-launch.

Use A/B testing or pre-post analysis.

Analyze engagement, retention, conversions.

Compare with baseline metrics or control group.

25. What’s the difference between correlation and causation in analytics?
Answer:

Correlation: Two metrics move together (may be coincidental).

Causation: One metric directly causes change in another.

Example:

Ice cream sales and drowning deaths are correlated (summer), but one doesn’t cause the other.
